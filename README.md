# AIST2010 Course Project: Music creation with SuperCollider

## What you can do in the game

- Create your own pieces of music by using the 16 short sound pieces and three background music patterns.
- Click the buttons to add the sound effects to the timeline. 
- Visualize the waveform of the sound as long as the music is playing.
- Record and save the sound as a file after creating your own music pieces.

## Project Structure

All the code is written in the file `project.scd`.  All the image files, which are the icons of the buttons, should be put in the same directory as the code file. 

To run the code, open the code file with SuperCollider, select all and run the code to start the music creation game.
